Hi this is Billy.  

I am currently studying <b>Information Engineering</b> at <i>City University of Hong Kong</i>. 

I had been to Finland taking courses about <b>Human-Centered Design</b> and  <b>Web Architecture</b> and <b>Data Structure</b>  at <i>Tampere University of Technology</i>.

Considering that the image display and code block functions in <i>markdown</i> are useful for me to generalizing my notes , I decided to create a blog to record my learing events instead of using my poor hand-writing to jot notes . It will be easier for me to do revisions and search for references.



 Bucket List :
- React Revision
- Docker
- Web AR development 
  - three.js (WebGL JS library) for FYP (very very very big project)!

You can check out my projects at this github : <data data-icon="ei-sc-github"></data>  [bill0930](https://github.com/bill0930)
