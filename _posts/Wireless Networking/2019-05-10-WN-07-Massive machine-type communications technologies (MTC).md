### Consumer vs Industrial IoT domains

-  **Industrial IoT** is similar to the **consumer IoT**, 
-  but the difference is that it has this is used in a commercial area that is **industries**.

-  They connect with each other using different standards for different applications



### Short-Range Access Technologies for IoT

-  **Historical** solutions (Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4, IETF stacks,…) are evolving to maintain competitiveness in growing IoT market
-  ***IEEE 802.11ah***(HaLow), low-cost, large-scale connectibity across massive deployments
-  ***Unlicensed Low-Power Wide Area (LPWA)*** networks rapidly emerge to support early stages of the IoT development, until standardized cellular M2M solutions enter the market.

### Tactile Internet 

-  The Tactile Internet will be the next evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing human-to-machine and machine-to-machine interaction. 
-  It will enable real-time interactive systems with a raft of industrial, societal and business use cases.
