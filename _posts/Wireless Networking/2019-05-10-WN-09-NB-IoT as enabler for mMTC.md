# NB-IoT as enabler for mMTC

## NB-IoT

-  Narrow Band Internt of Thing （窄帶物聯網）
-  is a standards-based low power wide area (LPWA) technology developed to enable a wide range of new IoT devices and services。
-  significantly improves the power consumption of user devices, system capacity and spectrum efficiency, especially in deep coverage
-  10 years battery life 
-  Each device habing TCP/IP stack



## IoT market landscape

-  28 billions of connected devices by 2021
-  IoT market USD 19 trillions by 2026
-  More than 10<sup>4</sup>  companies involved by 2020



## IoT Classification 

-  Massive IoT

-  Mission-critial IoT

-  Container monitoring is IoT
-  Most cargo vessels are close coast
-  They use statellite links for IoT

-  use onshore NB-IoT infrastructure 
   -  direct offloading
   -  ship-mounted relays
   -  UAV relays
