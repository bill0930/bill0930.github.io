# Vehicular and Aerial Communication 

### Networks in 5G era and Beyond 

-  The "Big Three" 5G technologies
   -  Ultra-densification
      -  Leads to **gross over-provisioning** and more complex **interference management**
      -  requires **massive investment** by mobile operators
   -  mmWave radios
   -  Massive MIMO

### Emerging Research Vision Beyond 5G (B5G)

-  High-bandwidth
-  Large number
-  Very realiable

-  Intelligent connected and moving machines
   -  Massive mobile AR/VR/MR galsses
   -  Very large fleets of autonomous vehicles
   -  Cooperating drone swarms
   -  Collabortive moving robots

### Research Challenges Beyond 5G

-  Access supply has been well-studied in the past
   -  but implication of **user demand remain largely unexplored**
-  Rethink wireless system design and content delivery for better matching the irregular user demand with the network access suplly in 5G systems
-  **Proposed solution**
   -  **dynamic and mobile network infrastructures** that intelligently leverage provisional and personal radio access equipment
      -  Offer truly flexible and *on-demand* network architecture **by involving operator**- and user-owned connected machines without the associated high costs
      -  Employ **mobile base stations** equipped with high-rate (e.g., mmWave) radio access capabilities
      -  Leverage multi-radio uplink, downlink, direct device-to-device (D2D) links, as well as **vehicle- and drone-assisted access**

### Expected Impact 

-  <u>Breakthrough goal</u>
   -  **reliable people-aware connectivity** where  space-time supply and demand may be shaped *opportunistically* 
      -  User-owned machines (high-end wearables, cars, drones, etc.)
      -  take  a more active role in **5G+ service provisioning** (especially in *partial coverage* situations 
         -  Functional disparity between the network and the user equipment is rapidly becoming blurred
-  <u>Theoretical benefits</u>
   -  Orders of magnitude better **network capacity scaling**
      -  Number of base stations: K
      -  Min number of antennas : n 
      -  Avaliable bandwidth : W  
      -  Network capacity = $K \times n \times W \times log(SNR)$
-  <u>Practical benefits</u> 
   -  clearly noticeable more stable and smoother **user connectivity experience**
   -  This research accentuates the **importance of people** as an integral component of beyond-5G system infrastructure with multiple impacts in ***industry***, ***education***, and ***community outreach***
