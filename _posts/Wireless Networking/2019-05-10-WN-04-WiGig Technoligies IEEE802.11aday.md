# WiGig Technoligies IEEE802.11ad/ay

## IEEE 802.11 ad

### IEEE 802.11ad History

-  announed in May 2009
-  WiGig and Wifi-F Alliane merged in March 2013
-  Wi-Fi Alliance announced the launch of its WiGig certification  program in Oct 2016 



### 802.11ad Very High Through(VHT) main specs

-  60Ghz
-  four 2.16 Ghz and 8Ghz bandwidth
-  Each channels supports up to 6.75675 Gbps (OFDM)
-  Single Channel up to 2.224 Gbps
-  1-10 meters
-  up to 32 antennas 



## IEEE 802.11ay

### Project Goals

-  Modification to both 802.11 PHY layer and MAC layer
-  enables a maximum throughput of at least 20 Gbps

### 802.11ay Very High Throughput (VHT) main specs

-  60Ghz 
-  Link rate per stream 20-44Gbps
-  Backward compatible with 802.11 ad
-  With *channel bounding* provides up to 8.64 GHz bandwidth
   -  two adjacent channels within a given frequency band are combined to increase throughput between two or more wireless devices.
-  MIMO support up to four streams (up to 176Gbps)
-  802.11ay supports 256QAM



### ay Future deployments

-  High performance public wifi networks in 2019
-  pre-strandard 802.1ay chipsets strted shipping in 2018
