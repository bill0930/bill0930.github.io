# Cellular technologies Evolution Toward 4G



### Histroy 

-  First commercial mobile network prototypes appeared in the 60’s
-  In US Inporved Mobile Telephone Service system were used also in cars
   -  25 Watts of transmtter power at the mobile station
   -  100-250 Watts at the terminal
   -  Pure FDMA
   -  40-60miles of BS coverage

### Realization

-  Difficulties in implementation of the user equipment of normal size of weight
-  Coverage, Capacity, interference and other issues
-  Need to cover the whole world with a hundreds of properly designed radio transceivers and connect them to the control center.



#### Why Base stations not satellites

-  transmission power will be insufficient
-  delay will be higher
-  core network placement?
-  capacity and interference limitation
-  Coverage limitations
-  Satellite deployment and support price is much higher



### Commercial Mobile Networks 

-  **1st Generation** 
   -  1980s
   -  Standard: NMT, AMPS
   -  FDMA used to separate users
   -  Sectoring Techniques appeared on a base station side
   -  Not encrypted voice traffic
   -  FM- Used
   -  automatic switching (Dial)
-  **2G and popularity**
   -  1990s
   -  GMS and IS-95
   -  TDMA and CDMA mechanism used to divide users
   -  FSK digital modulation is used
   -  Compression, multiplexing, codecs usgae
   -  A5/2 encryption (in GSM)
   -  SIM cards introducted in 2G(Carriers network - speicfic information)
   -  Growth of a number of subscribers
-  **2G NON-commercial networks**
   -  TETRA used by governement agencies, emergency serivies 
   -  basic features of a standard 
      -  direct-mode operation (DMO) or using trunked-mode operation (TMO)
      -  Call priorites
      -  Group calls(1-to1, 1-to-many, many-to-many)
      -  Relay communication
      -  Call querying instead of blocking
-  **2.5 - 3G Data transmission networks**
   -  2.5G
      -  GPRS(General Packet Radio Service) up to 50kpbs
      -  EDGE(Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) up to 250 kbps
   -  2 domains
      -  Circuit Switch(voice transmission) 
      -   Packet Switch (data transmission)
   -  3G prioritized development of data transmission part
   -  3G
      -  UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)
      -  CDMA2000(2.5G to 3G world wide)
      -  Applications
         -  Moible TV, Video Conferencing….
      -  Extensions (3.5-3.9G)
         -  HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+, UMB
      -  1-2Mbps data rates



### PHY and MAC differences between 3 generations

-  PHY and MAC improvements

-  CDMA advantage

   -  flexibility of resource usgae (high number of codes with different rates), not the capacity
   -  much more resistant to narrow band interference
   -  Connection to 2 more base stations at the same time is possible with one transcevier(different codes)

### 4th Generation

####  
- WiMax and LTE main technology candidates 
- both more or less similar data rates, QoS and equipemnt price 
- WHY LTE

   - need to replace all mobile phones when using WiMax
   - Network Core itself is not needed anymore
- 4G LTE PHY and MAC
  
  -  MAC layer
     -  *OFDMA* as an medium access mechanism
     -  More improved flexibility of a resource usage
  -  PHY layer
     -  Imporved antenna techniques such as MIMO
- 4G base station

   -  Reduced energy consumption
   -  Reduced size (more than 2 times)
   -  Reduced cost
   -  simplicity of replacement
- 4G user devices and applications
   - Smartphones, Tablets
   - Stream Video and video calls 
   - Online Gaming, cellular, location-based sevice
   - Interference and capacity problems 



### 5G 

-  100x capacity boost
-  Introduction of more D2D, Heterogeneous Network. Machine –Type (MTC)
-  Flexibility and Speed
-  MTC and D2D under development
