## 3. Rationale for adopting human-centred Design

- Has substantial economic and social benefits for **users**, **employers** and **supplier**

- Taking a human-centred design approach also **increases the likelihood of completing the project** successfully, on time,
- **reduce the risk of the product failing to meet stakeholder requirements** or being rejected by its users.



Systems designed using human-centred methods improve quality

1. Increase the **productivity of users** and the **operational effciency of organizations**
2. Being **easier to understand and use**, thus reducing training and support cost
3. Increasing usability for people with a wider range of capabilities and thus **increasing accessbility.**
4. Improving **user experience**
5. Reducing **discomfort** and stress
6. Providing a competitive advantage, for example by **improving brand image**
7. Contributing towards **sustainability** objective.

## 4. Principle of human-centred design

### 4.1 General 

- a framework for human-centred design.

- All the human-centred design activities identified in Clause 6 are applicable (to a greater or lesser
  extent) at any stage in the development of a system.
  
- | <u>Human-Centred Approach Principles</u>                     |
  | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | The design is based upon an **explicit understanding** of users, tasks and environments |
  | **Users are involved** throughout design and development     |
  | The design is driven and refined by **user-centred evaluation** |
  | The process is **iterative**                                 |
  | The design **addresses** the whole **user experience**       |
  | The design team includes **multidisciplinary skills and perspectives** |
  
  

### 4.2 The design is based upon an *explicit understanding* of users, tasks and environments

Products, systems and services should be designed to take account of the people who will use them as well as other stakeholder groups, including those who might be affected (directly or indirectly) by their use

### 4.3 Users are *involved throughout design and development* 

The people who are involved should have *capabilities*, *characteristics* and *experience* that reflect the range of users for whom the system is being designed. 

### 4.4 The design is *driven and refined by user-centred evaluation*

Evaluating designs with users and improving them based on their feedback provides an effective means of minimizing the risk of a system not meeting user or organizational needs (including those requirements that are hidden or difficult to specify explicitly)

### 4.5 The process is *iterative*

Iteration should be used to progressively eliminate uncertainty during the development of interactive systems. Iteration implies that descriptions, specifications and prototypes are revised and refined when new information is obtained in order to minimize the risk of the system under development failing to meet user requirements.

### 4.6 The design addresses the whole user experience

User experience is a consequence of the presentation, functionality, system performance, interactive
behaviour, and assistive capabilities of an interactive system, both hardware and software. It is also a
consequence of the user's prior experiences, attitudes, skills, habits and personality. 

### 4.7 The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives

Human-centred design teams do not have to be large, but the team should be sufficiently diverse to collaborate over design and implementation trade-off decisions at appropriate times.

human factors and ergonomics, usability, accessibility, human-computer interaction, user research,  users and other stakeholder groups, marketing, branding, sales, technical support and maintenance, health and safety, user interface, visual and product design,technical writing, training, user support,  user management, service management and corporate governance, human resources, sustainability					 						 					 				 			 		



## 5. Planning human-centred design 

### 5.1 General

Human-centred design shall be planned and integrated into all phases of the product life cycle, i.e. conception, analysis, design, implementation, testing and maintenance.



### 5.2 Responsibility

Those responsible for planning the project shall consider the relative importance of human factors/ergonomics in the project by evaluating:

(需要考慮human factors/ergonomics在該project的重要性by評估以下項目)

a) 	How ***usability* relates to the purpose and use of product**, system or service(size,no. of users, realtionship with other systems, safety or health issues, accessibility, specialist application, extreme environments

b)	 The levels of various types of **risk that might result from poor *usability*** <br>*（usability差的時候引致的風險*）

c) 	The nature of ***the development environment***(e.g. size of project, time to market,range of technologies, internal or external project, type of contract )



### 5.3 Content of plan

The planning of human-centred design shall include:

1. identifying **appropriate methods** and resources for the activities  for **Clauses 6** (4.2-4.7)
2. defining **procedues** and integrating these activities and their outputs with other system development activities
3. identifying the **individuals** and the **organization** **responsible for the human-centred design activities** and **the range of skills** and viewpoints they provided
4. developing effective procedures for **establishing feedback and communciation** on human-centred design activities as they affect other design activities and "trade-off"s, and **methods for documenting outputs** from these activities
5. **agreeing** on appropriate **milestones** for human-centred activities that are i**ntegrated into the overall design** and development process
6. **agreeing** on **suitable timescales to allow iteration, use of feedback and possible design changes** to be incorporated into the project schedule. 



### 5.4  Integration with project plan

the plan for human-centred design **should be subject to the same project disciplines** (e.g. responsibilities, change control) as other key activities. 

The human-centred design **aspects of the project plan should be reviewed and revised appropriately as requirements change** throughout the life of the project.



## 6 Human-centred design activities

### 6.1 General

four linked human-centred design activities shall take place during the design of any interactive system:

1. understanding and specifying *the **context of use*** (see 6.2);  （
2. specifying the ***user requirements*** (see 6.3); 
3. producing ***design solutions*** (see 6.4); 
4. ***evaluating*** the design (see 6.5). 

![hcd_activities](./img/hcd_activities.png)

### 6.2 Understanding and specifying the context of use

#### 6.2.1 General

The characteristics of the users, tasks and organizational, technical and physical environment define the context in which the system is used. It is useful to gather and analyse information on the current context in order to understand, and then specify, the context that will apply to the future system

#### 6.2.2 Context-of-use description

The context-of-use description shall include the following:

- The users and other stakeholder groups
- The characteristics of the users or groups of users
- The goals and tasks of the users
- The environment(s) of the system

#### 6.2.3 Sufficient detail to support design

The context of use of the system should be described in **sufficient detail to support the requirements, design and evaluation activities**.

#### 6.2.4 Context of use specified for design

The context of use specified for design (i.e. the context in which the system will be used) should be stated in the user requirements specification to clearly identify the conditions under which the requirements apply.



### 6.3 Specifying the user requirements

#### 6.3.1 General

In most design projects, identifying user needs and specifying the functional and other requirements for the product or system is a major activity. For human-centred design, this activity shall be extended to create an explicit statement of user requirements in relation to the intended context of use and the business objectives
of the system.

#### 6.3.2 Identifying user and other stakeholder needs

User and other stakeholder needs should be identified, taking account of the context of use. These should include that which users need to achieve (rather than how to achieve it) and any constraints imposed by the context of use.

#### 6.3.3 Deriving user requirements

| User Requirements Should Include                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| the intended context of use                                  |
| **requirements** derived from **user needs** and the context of use — for example, there might be a requirement for a product to be used outdoors; |
| **requirements** arising from relevant ergonomics and user interface knowledge, standards and **guidelines** (ISO XXXX) |
| **usability requirements** and objectives, including measurable usability performance and satisfaction criteria in specific contexts of use |
| requirements derived from **organizational requirements** that directly affect the use |

#### 6.3.4 Resolving trade-offs between user requirement

Potential conflicts between user requirements, e.g. between accuracy and speed, should be resolved.

#### 6.3.5 Ensuring the quality of user requirements specifications

The user requirements specification should be 

1. stated in terms that permit subsequent testing, 
2. verified by the relevant stakeholders, 
3. internally consistent, and 
4. updated as necessary during the life of the project 



### 6.4 Producing design solutions

#### 6.4.1 General

Design decisions have a major impact on the user experience. Human-centred design aims to achieve a good user experience by considering it throughout the design process

1. designing user tasks, user-system interaction and user interface to meet user requirements, **taking into consideration the whole user experience**;

2. making the design solutions more **concrete** (for example making use of scenarios, simulations, prototypes or mock-ups); 
3. altering the design solutions **in response to user-centred evaluation** and **feedback** (see 6.5 for details on user evaluation); 

4. **communicating the design solutions** to those responsible for their implementation 

#### 6.4.2. Designing user tasks, user–system interaction and user interface to meet user requirements, taking into consideration the whole user experience

##### 6.4.2.1 Principles for design 

- Suitability for the task( the fact of being acceptable or right for something or someone)
- Self-descriptiveness （to describe itself with no external help）
- Confomity with user expectations（一致性）
- Suitability for learning  （it is necessary to learn how to use certain functions of a product, this should be as easy as possible）
- Controllability(可控性)
- error tolerance
- suitability for individualization （users can adapt the product to their own needs）

##### 6.4.2.2 Designing the tasks and interaction between user and system

Appropriate design of the user–system interaction relies on a clear understanding of the intended context of use, including the users' roles and tasks and their outputs. This understanding enables an appropriate allocation of functions to be achieved, i.e. the division of system tasks into those performed by humans and those performed by technology.

Designing the interaction should include

- Making high-level decisions(initial design concept)
- Identifying tasks and sub-tasks
- Allocating tasks and sub-tasks to the users and to other parts of the system
- Identifying the interaction objects required for the completion of the tasks
- Identifying and selecting appropriate dialogue techniques
- Designing the dequence and timing of the interaction
- Designing the information architecture of the user interface of an interactive system to allow efficient access to interaction objects. 

##### 6.4.2.3 Designing the user interface

For the detailed design of the user interface, there is a substantial body of ergonomics and user interface
knowledge, standards and guidelines which should be used to inform the design of both hardware and
software.



These include standards within the ISO 9241 series on displays, input devices, dialogue principles,
menus, presentation of information, user guidance, and other user interface and accessibility guidelines. 



#### 6.4.3 Making design solutions more concrete



Using **scenarios**, **simulations**, **models** and mock-ups or other forms of **prototype** enables designers to
communicate the proposed design to users and other stakeholders to obtain feedback.

Benefits

1. Making **design more explicit**
2. Allow designers to **explore serveral design concepts** before they settle on one
3. Making it possible to incorporate **user feedback** into the design early in the devleopment process
4. Making it possible to evaluate **several iterations of a design** and alternative designs
5. **improving the quality and completeness** of the functional design specification. 



#### 6.4.4 Altering the design solutions based on user-centred evaluation and feedback

Feedback from **evaluation** should be used to **improve** and refine the system 



#### 6.4.5 Communicating the design solution to those responsible for implementation

Whatever the nature of the overall project, there should be **some sustained channel of communication between those responsible for human-centred design and other members of the project team**. When design solutions are communicated, they should be accompanied by an explanation and justification of the design decisions, especially where trade-offs are necessary.

### 6.5 Evaluating the design

#### 6.5.1 General

User-centred evaluation (evaluation based on users' perspective) is a required activity in human-centred design.

User-centred evaluation can be used to

- collect new information about user needs
- provide feedback on **strengths** and **weaknesses** of the design solution **from the user's perspective** (in order to improve design )
- asses whether user requirements have been achieved which can include assessing conformity to international, national, local, corporate or statutory standards.
- establish **baselines** or make comparisons between designs 

#### 6.5.2 Conducting user-centred evaluation

- allocating resources both to obtain **early feedback** in order to **improve** the proudct , and at a **later stage**, to determine whether the requiremnts have been **satisfied**
- planning the user-centred **evaluation** so that it **fits the project schedule** 
- carrying out **sufficiently comprehensive testing** to provide meaningful results for the system as a whole 
- **analysing the results**, prioritizing issues and proposing **solutions**; 
- **communicating the solutions appropriately** so that they can be used effectively by the design team 



#### 6.5.3 User-centred evaluation methods

 ISO/TR 16982.![Usability_Method](/Users/billy/Documents/Learning_Notes/HCPD/Workshop/img/Usability_Method.png)



#### 6.5.4 User-based testing

User-based testing can be undertaken at any stage in the design.

At **a very early stage**, users can be presented with models, scenarios or sketches of the design concepts and asked to evaluate them in relation to a real context.

When **prototypes are being tested**, the users should carry out tasks using the prototype rather than just be
shown demonstrations or a preview of the design. The information gathered is used to drive the design.

At **a later stage** in the development, user-based testing can be carried out to assess whether usability
objectives, including measurable usability performance and satisfaction criteria, have been met in the intended
context or contexts of use.

Techniques that can be used to gather data from field validation include *help-desk data, field reports, incident analysis, near-miss reports, log files, defect reports, real user feedback, performance data, satisfaction surveys, reports of health impacts, design improvements, user observation and requests for changes.*



#### 6.5.5 Inspection-based evaluation

Inspection-based evaluation can be **valuable** and **cost-effective** and can also complement user testing. It can be used to eliminate major issues before user testing and hence make user testing more cost-effective.

Inspection-based evaluation is ideally **performed by usability experts** who base their judgement on prior experience of problems encountered by users and their own knowledge of ergonomic guidelines and standards.

Inspection-based evaluation can be supported by checklists, lists of user requirements, general
usability guidance, industry best practices, usability heuristics, guidelines or standards.

The effectiveness of the inspection always depends on the skills, experience and knowledge of the evaluators



#### 6.5.6 Long-term monitoring

A human-centred design process should also include long-term monitoring of the use of the product, system or service. This involves collecting user input in different ways over **a period of time.**

Follow-up evaluation is often a formal part of system evaluation and is carried out within a specific time frame, e.g. six months to a year after the system is installed.

Some effects of working with an interactive product, system or service **are not recognizable until it has been used for a period of time**.

## 7 Sustainability and human-centred design

Human-centred design directly supports the first two pillars of sustainability:

- | Sustainability | Description                                                  |
  | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Economic       | matching a design to users' needs and abilities enhances its utilization, **quality** and **efficiency**, thus providing **cost-effective** solutions and reducing the likelihood that systems products and services will be *wasteful* or *rejected* by their users; |
  | social         | taking a human-centred approach results in systems, products and services that are better for the **health**, **well-being** and **engagement** of their users, including users with **disabilities**. |
