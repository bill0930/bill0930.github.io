# Workshop 2 - Standards and Future Studies


## Standard

### Standards

Document that provides **requirements**, **specifications** , **guidelines** or **characteristics** that can be used <u>consistently</u> to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.



### ISO

**International Organization for Standardization** - independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 161 national standards



### Standardization

The **process of implementation and developing technical standards, based on the consensus of different parties** that include firms, users, interest groups, standards organizations and government



### Good things about standard

ensures that the products and services are

- safe
- reliable
- of good quality



**ISO 9241-210:Ergonomics of human-system interaction**

## Future Studies

### Future Studies

Is the systematic study of **possible, probable and preferable futures** including the worldviews and myths that underlie each future.



### Holistic futurism（整體未來主義）

An attempt to **reduce errors and biases of predicting** through cross referencing different *new disciplines of science*. 

| Possible Science                                        | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| <u>Probability Theory</u>                               | attempt to calculate risk and chance                    |
| <u>System Theory</u>                                    | World as a system of connections                        |
| <u>Game Theory</u>                                      | Powerful predictive systems in terms of human behaviour |
| <u>Socioeconomics, <br />BIG DATA<br />psychonomics</u> |                                                         |
|                                                         |                                                         |

### Trend (趨勢)

a general development or change in a situation or in the way that people are behaving



### Week Signals （微弱信號）

Understood as **advanced, noisy and socially situated indicators of change in trends and systems** that constitute raw informational material for **enabling anticipatory action**.

> 當年有微弱訊號顯示，數位攝影將很快變成主流，但柯達公司的領導人未能有效放大與解讀這訊號，並據以採取行動

The ambiguous interpretations, unclear obeservations may become a trend or "die away"



### Micro trends

a **tendency** in the direction of some phenomenon that is **fairly pervasive** within a given sphere of influence or intelligent, leading and structure-changing innovations. They are the **first concrete signs** of *emerging trend movements*.

> - Specific shifts in consumer behavior that are changing the business environment in the short-term.
>
> - A micro trend typically lasts 3 to 5 years. 



### Macro trends

 a **pervasive and persistent shift** in the direction of some phenomenon on a global level.

> - urbanization, automation and changing demographics(study of a population based on factors such as age, race and sex.)
>
> - A macro trend typically lasts for 5-10 years



### Mega trends

provides an interpretation of the direction of **global change-related phenomena**

#### Futures wheel

![img](https://insightmaker.com/sites/default/files/stories/93847/image_1.png)

#### Traditional Forecasting

Traditional forecasting, <u>using historical observations</u> estimate future business metrics such as inventory requirements, asset performance, budgets and revenue. 

#### Trend Impact Analysis   （趨勢分析）

Technique in forecasting where

 (1) baseline scenario constructed using trends
 (2) Future events are identified and evaluated for degree of impact 
(3) combined effects of 1 and 2 used to create future scenarios.

#### Cross-Impact Analysis  （交叉影響分析）

 To help determine <u>how relationships between events</u> would <u>impact resulting events and reduce uncertainty in the future</u>

Branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and information technology firm Gartner to <u>represent the maturity, adoption, and social application of specific technologies</u>
