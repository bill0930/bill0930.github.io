# Graph Algorithms

### General 

-  A graph 
  
   -   is a data structure consists of *nodes*(vertex) and *edges*
   -  can be *undirected* or *directed* 
   
- Graph $G = (V,E)$
      -  V = set of vetices 
      -  E = set of edges
  
   -  If only one edge to each direction between nodes
      -  $E\subseteq V^2$ 
       -  for a directed $|E|$ can alter between 0,….$|V|^2$
  
-  Two way to represent a graph in a computer

  -  **adjacency list** 
    -  sum of the sizes of all adjacency lists of the graph is 
      -  $|E|$ for directed graph, $2|E|$ for undirected graph
    -  Memory consumption $O(max(V,E)) = O(V+E)$
  -  **adjacency matrix**
    -  is a $|V |\times |V| $ matrix A , where the element $a_{ij}$ is
      -  0, there is no edge from vertex i to j
      -  1, there is an edge from i to j
    -  Memory consumption is always $\Theta(V^2)$

### Terminology

-  Step : moving from one *vertex* to another *vertex* along an *edge*
   -  follow the direction in directed graph
-  the distance of the vertex $v_{2}$ from the vertex $v_{1}$ is the length of the shrotest path from $v_1$ to $v_2$ 
   -  distance from itself is 0
   -  $\delta({v_1,v_2})$ denoted
   -  $\delta({v_1,v_2}) \ne\delta({v_2,v_1}) $  is common in directed graph 
   -  if no path, then $\delta({v_1,v_2}) = \infin$
-  Color
   -  White =  discovered 
   -  grey = discovered but not complelty processed
   -  black = discovered and processed
   -  white —> grey —> black

### Breadth-first Search

```pseudocode
v->d // the distance of vertex from x
v->π  // a pointer to the vertex through which v was found the first time, NIL for undiscovered vertices (predecessor)
v->color // the color white, grey ,black
v->Adj //the set of the neighbours of v


BFS(s) // s is the source
// set all the vertices  color = WHITE, d = ∞ π = NIL

s->grey // set it as discovered
s->d := 0  // source distance is 0
PUSH(Q,s)	// pish the source into the queue

While !Q.empty() do{
	u:= pop(Q)		// take the next vertex from the queue
	for each v ∈  u→Adj  // go trhough each neightobur 
		if v->color = WHITE then
			v-> color := GREY
			v->d: u->d + 1// incrmeent the distance 
			v-> π := u  // vertex v was reached through u
			PUSH(Q,v)
	u->color := BLACK // make it processed 
} 
```

-  before calling the algorithm the nodes need to be initialised and it takes $ O(V) $
-  Scans the out Adj edges of the vertex,
-  each queue operation is a constant time
-  amount of WHILE loop takes $ O(V) $ because each vertex can be pushed into the queue once
-  amount of FOR loop is exected at most $O(E)$ goes through each edge once into both direction 
-  The running time of BFS is  $O(V+E)$ 

```pseudocode
PRINT-PATH(G,s,v)
if v=s then  //base case 
	print s
else if (v->π = NIL) then // the search didnt reach the vertex v at all 
	print "no path"
else 
	PRINT-PATH(G,s,v->π) //recursive call 
	print v					//print afterwards
	
```

e.g PRINT-PATH(G,a,h) —> RETURN a,b,c,h

### Depth-first Search

![File:Depth-First-Search.gif](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Depth-First-Search.gif)

-  only <u>vertices that havent been seen before</u> are accepted into the path
-  once the algorihm cannot go further , it backtracks only as much as is needed in order to find a new route forwaeds
-  the algotirhm <u>stops</u> once it <u>backtracks back to the source</u> and there are no unexplored edges left there

DIfference to BFS

-  Instead of a queue the vertes waiting to be processed are put into a stack
-  the algorithm doesnt find the shortest paths but path 

```pseudocode
v->d // the distance of vertex from x
v->π  // a pointer to the vertex through which v was found the first time, NIL for undiscovered vertices (predecessor)
v->color // the color white, grey ,black
v->Adj //the set of the neighbours of v

DFS(s)  // s is the source
// set all the vertices  color = WHITE, d = ∞ π = NIL
PUSH(S,s)
while !S.empty do
	u:= POP(S) 			// pop the latest vertex added to the stack
	if u->color = WHITE then // if it is unprocessed
		u->colour := GREY	//mark it discovered 
		PUSH(S,u)			// Push it into the stack
		for each v ∈ u→Adj do 
			if v->color = WHITE then
				push (S,v)
			else if v->color = GREY then // Grey node, CYCLE IS FOUND
				//cycle handling
				
	else 
		u->color := BLACK 		//all neighbours handled 
				
```

Efficiency 

-  Before calling the algorithm the nodes need to be initlaized so it takes $O(V)$
-  stack operation is $\Theta(1)$
-  The while loop makes atmost $O(V)$ rounds
-  The algorithm goes through each edge once into both directions ,it takes $O(V+E)$

```pseudocode
Recuisive DFS

DFS(u)   
u->colour := GRAY
for each v ∈ u→Adj do
	if v->colour = WHITE then  // if v hasn't been visited
		DFS(v)						//contiue to search recursively from v
	else if v->colour = GRAY then	// if has been visited but not fully processed
		//	a loop is found
v-> colour := BLACK				//Mark node as fully processed
```

Running time

-  a vertex is colored grey at the begining of the function
   -  DFS is called atmost $O(V)$
-  There are atmost $O(E)$ rounds of the for loop
-  other operations are constant time
-  The running time is $O(V+E)$



### BFS vs DFS

-  BFS can be used for searching the shortest path
-  if the stae space of the graph is larget, the BFS takes significantly larger amount of memory
   -  e.g arificial intelligence application
-  DFS used for searching for loops
   -  the grey nodes form a path from the source to the current vetex
   -  only black or grey vertices can be accessed through a black vertex
      -  if a grey vertex can be reached from the current vertex, there is a loop in the graph





### Dijkstra's Algorithm

![Dijkstra's algorithm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Dijkstra_Animation.gif)

-  ***weight*** can be added to the edges of the graph
  
   -  can presen<u>t the length of the route</u> or the cost of <u>the state transition</u>
   -  The shortest route from the source to vertex
      -  is the one <u>whose combined weight of the edges **as small as possible**</u>
   
-  The weight of each edge is 1, the problem can be solved with scanning through the part of graph reachable from the source  with BFS

-  if the weights can be < 0, it is possible that there is no solution to the problem
  
   -  although there are possible paths in the graph
   
-  The algorithm is used for <u>shortest weighted paths</u>
   -  find the shortest paths from the source $s$ to all vertices reachale from $s$
      -  by weighting the lengths of the edges with $w$
   -  choose in each situation  that the shortest path that hasn't investigated yet
      -  Greedy algorithm
   
-  The algorithm uses a data Structure $Q$, which means $\text{Priority Queue} $

-  $w$ contains the weights of all edges

-  $Relax$ algorithm
   -  relaxation of the edge($v,u$)
      -  tests could the shortest path found to vertex $v$ be improved
      -  by routing its end through $u$ and does so if necessary
   
   ```pseudocode
   v->d // the distance of vertex from x
   v->π  // a pointer to the vertex through which v was found the first time, NIL for undiscovered vertices (predecessor)
   v->color // the color white, grey ,black
   v->Adj //the set of the neighbours of v
    Q is the Priority Queue
    
   DIJKSTRA(s,w)   // s as the source
   // set all the vertices  color = WHITE, d = ∞ π = NIL
   s->colour := GRAY  //mark it discorvered
   s->d  := 0			// the distance from the source to itself is 0
   PUSH(Q,s) 			// coutinue while there are vetices left
   While !Q.empty   //Where there are vetices left
   	u:= EXTRACT-MIN(Q) take the next vertex from the priority queue
   	for each v ∈ u→Adj do //go through the neighbours of u
   		if v->colour:=WHITE then // if the node hasnt been visited 
   			v->colour := GRAY 		//mark it found
   			PUSH(Q,v)				//push the vertex into the queue
   		RELAX(u,v,w)
   	u->colour :=BLACK 			//mark u as processed
   	
   RELAX(u,v,w)
   if(v->d    >   u->d + w(u,v) )		// if a new shorter route tov was found
   	v-> d := u->d + w(u,v)		//update the distance
   	v→π := u 						//update the parent 
   	
   ```
   
   

Running-Time

-  While loop takes $O(V)$ rounds and the for loop takes atmost $O(E)$ rounds 

-  The priority queue can be implemented efficiently with a heap or less efficiently with a list

   -  |                                                  | HEAP        | LIST        |
      | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
      | empty data structure insertion                   | $\Theta(1)$ | $\Theta(1)$ |
      | check the priority queue empty                   | $\Theta(1)$ | $\Theta(1)$ |
      | Extract Min                                      | $O(logV)$   | $O(V)$      |
      | Push the data into the queue                     | $\Theta(1)$ | $\Theta(1)$ |
      | Relaxation can change the priority of the vertex | $O(logV)$   | $\Theta(1)$ |

   

-  $O((V+E)logV)$



## A* Algorithm

-  *Dijkstra’s algorithm* finds the shortest weighted route by
   accessing the nodes in the order of shortest route

-  *A* algorithm* enhances this by adding a ***heuristic***  about the shortest possible distance to the goal (The direct distance in a road network)
   -  find the shortest weighted route from starting node $s$ to given goal node $g$. 
   -  Does **not** find the shortest route to **all nodes** 
   -  assumes that the minimum possible distance from any node to the goal can be calculated
   -  chooses in each situation a new node, whose is smallest.
-  Just changes the Relaxation

```pseudocode
RELAX-A* (u,v,w)
if v->d > u->d +w(u,v) then 	//if a shorter route to node v is found
	v-> d := u->d + w(u,v)		//new route this far
	v->de := v->d + min_est(v,goal) //minimum estimate for the whole route
	v→π := u 
```
