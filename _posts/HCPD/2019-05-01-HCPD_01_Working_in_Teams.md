#### Group formation

### Forming

- A group of people have come together to accomplish a shared purpose and the results can be unpredictable
- Anxiety is high, people are uncertain and they are overly polite and pleasant

#### Storming

- This stage is marked by conflict and competition as personalities and working styles begin to evolve
- The members of the team are unfamiliar on how to communicate with each other
- Teams may also disagree on goals and subgroups or cliques may form

#### Norming

- Begin to resolve their interpersonal differences, appreciate others and form working relationships
-  A sense of cohesion and unity and this allows for the team to work functionally together towards the end goal
- Performance increase as the team begins to cooperate and focus on the goals.

#### Performing

- Relationships are formed and there is a clear and stable structure
- The team is mature, organised and has a sense of consensus and cooperation
- The prime focus of the team is on problem solving and meeting goals; effectiveness is at its peak

#### Adjourning

- the point where the project comes to an end and the team separates and goes their separate ways
- Some team members may find this hard because they liked the routine of the group, have made close friendships or if the future
- After leaving this team, looks bleak and unpromising.
