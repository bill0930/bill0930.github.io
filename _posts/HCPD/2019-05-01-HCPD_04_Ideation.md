# Workshop 4 - Ideation

### Brainstorming

A group problem-solving technique that involves the **spontaneous**(非籌劃安排的)
**contribution of ideas** from all members of the group 

To brainstorm is to *use a set of specific rules and techniques* which encourage and **spark off new ideas which would never have happened under normal circumstances**

Quantity >>>>>>>> Quality 



#### Why Brainstroming?

because

 we need ideas, 

we have problems to solve

we are looking to improve creative thinking

we want our team to work together better



#### Rules for generating ideas?

1. Withhold judgement 
2. Encourage wild ideas (free-wheeling)

3. Build on the ideas of others
4. Stay focused on the topic
5. Be visual 
6. One conversation at a time
7. Go for quantity (not quality)
8. Have fun



#### Point of View

It is a meaningful and actionable problem statement, which allow will ideate and goal-oriented manner.

- [USER]  needs to  [USER'S NEED] because [INSIGHT]

- “How might we…?” 

- “In what ways might we…?”



#### Reverse Brainstorming

> Instead of asking how to solve the problem, reverse brainstorming focuses on the idea of what causes the problem or how to achieve an opposite result of what is expected. This method helps the team to understand the problem and highlight the ideas that can be used to solve it among other ideas discussed during the meeting. For example, the team thinks how to increase the cost instead of how to reduce it…etc.
